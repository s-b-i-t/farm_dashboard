      <h3>Senior Design Team 23</h3>
      <p>The project is a web-based application designed to be used by farmers.  
        This project is specifically implemented with the local Spring Valley Student Farm as the targeted users, 
        but it serves as a proof of concept for a wider array of applications.  This app supports local farmers 
        by predicting soil temperature (an important metric for estimating crop yields) using machine learning 
        models that access data from a weather station on campus.  Motivating this precision agriculture 
        project is the intention of improving the output of the student farm to better serve the UConn community.</p>
